# components/os

The desktop. Four rules that are not visible from the code and get broken
otherwise:

- **An app exists only through `lib/os/registry.tsx`.** Adding an entry to
  `APPS` is what puts it on the desktop and in the menu; nothing else renders a
  window. Apps receive `AppProps` (`arg`, `open`, `close`) and nothing more.
- **Tokens only.** No `neutral-*`, `zinc-*`, `white`, `black`, hex or `dark:`
  in classNames. Everything user-facing has to survive all four presets, and
  only the semantic colours in `tailwind.config.ts` do.
- **Bevels, not glass.** Chrome is `bevel-out` / `bevel-in` / `bevel-thin`.
  No `shadow-*`, no `backdrop-blur`, no `rounded-*` except `rounded-lg`, which
  is `var(--radius)`.
- **Icons are pixmaps.** Add a 16x16 entry to `lib/os/icons.tsx`; never add
  an icon package. The file's docblock says why.

Anything adapted from opensourceui.in follows
`docs/adr/0001-vendor-opensourceui-through-the-token-layer.md` and carries the
source header. Nothing here is observable from stdout: verify in a browser
with `.claude/skills/verify`.
